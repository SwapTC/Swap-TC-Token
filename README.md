# Swap-TC-Token

The only token using a Center of Mass Formula Tax System.

Our Center of Mass Taxation is based on a 19-Week Timestamped Decreasing-Tax System that we developed. Our system rewards holder loyalty on an individual basis as opposed to global taxation models. #OneSizeDoesNotFitAllInCrypto

Swap TC is the first crypto token to develop a system that rewards long-term holders on an individual basis.There's a 5% purchase fee for $SWAPTC which means slippage can be set from 6% to 12%. Swap TCâ€™s smart contract has an option to lower the buy tax rate temporarily for special occasions and promotional events.

Tax fees start at 30% but gradually decrease weekly until reaching 10%. Slippage can be as high as 40% for selling during high tax weeks. In summary, slippage will depend on liquidity, price impact, and tax amount. The estimated slippage for holders who are selling during the lowest tax week will be 12-18%. If a holder transfers tokens to a new wallet, the timeline will reset back to week zero.
